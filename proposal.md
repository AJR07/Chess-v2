# **General description of project**

Building an online pass-and-play chess engine. This will be hosted on a website where you can play chess!

# **Goals of project**

Experiment with making a chess engine that is functional, and in the future extend it for multiple users to be able to play it online. It will help me to iron out some of my skills with common typescript/react tools and just build a usable site in general. I want to do this so that I can have a chess app that I can use and implement whatever features I can whenever I want to.

# **Listing of features**

For when the features will be implemented, see [plans for specific features in the development log.](devlog.md)

- Game modes:
  - Pass and Play
  - Against an AI
  - Multiplayer (Potentially in the future)
  - 4-player? (Potentially in the future)
- Game Engine:
  - Renderer and basic UI
  - Verification of legal moves
  - Chess notation [in the future]
- Authentication/User Login: [in the future]
  - Login as a user
  - Store a profile picture, name, etc...
  - Interact with other users (friends list etc)
  - Leaderboards :D
- Chat function: [in the future]
  - Message other users on the platforms
  - Message other users in the game

# **Listing of Key Use Cases**

- For people (mainly me and my friends) to go online and play whenever we want to
- Not having to use some other website to play chess
- Being able to implement my own features whenever I want to
- Maybe to host some events in the school community???

# **Skills that my project requires me to pick up**

> Most of these skills I have an idea about, and it will probably not be covered in CEP but it is just listed here because I might still need to learn details about it.

- React.js
- Typescript
- Animation (Framer-Motion)
- Routing (React-router)
- UI (Material-Ui React)
- Databases (Firebase, React-Firebase Hooks)
- Authentication (Firebase Auth, Firebase Storage for profile picture etc)
