# **General description of project**

Building an online pass-and-play chess engine. This will be hosted on a website where you can play chess!

# Goals of project

Experiment with making a chess engine that is functional, and in the future extend it for multiple users to be able to play it online. I want to do this so that I can have a chess app that I can use and implement whatever features I can whenever I want to.

# Listing of features

For when the features will be implemented, see [plans for specific features in the development log.](devlog.md)

- Game modes:
  - Pass and Play
  - Against an AI
  - Multiplayer (Potentially in the future)
  - 4-player? (Potentially int he future)
- Game Engine:
  - Renderer and basic UI
  - Verification of legal moves
  - Chess notation
- Authentication/User Login:
  - Login as a user
  - Store a profile picture, name, etc...
  - Interact with other users (friends list etc)
  - Leaderboards :D
- Chat function: [If there is time]
  - Message other users on the platforms
  - Message other users in the game
