# **Development Log**

> - What goals you had set for the week and whether they were accomplished or not
> - What problems you encountered (if any) that prevented you from meeting your goals
> - What you plan to accomplish or attempt next week

### **Week 5 (26 Jul - 1 Aug)**

- Goal: **Basic setup + Chessboard Update** [COMPLETED - on week 6]
  - Setup the project
  - Install required dependencies
  - Setup any readme files
  - Get the chessboard represented on the website
  - Chessboard FEN Parser and Interpreter
  - Chessboard Legal Moves Checker (if have time)
- Problems:
  - Most of the time was spent on brainstorming and getting the project setup
  - A large part of the last 2 goals were not done, but was completed the next week

### **Week 6 (2 Aug - 8 Aug)**

- Goal: **Chess Single-player update** [COMPLETED - on week 10]
  - Ensure chess engine works
  - Test chess engine
  - Represent chess engine on the website
  - FEN parsing and displaying on the website
  - Pass and play complete
- Problems:
  - Unfortunately, having OBS on this week meant that a large part of the week I didn't have enough rest and motivation to make a lot of progress
  - There was a bunch of other details I had to iron out, and was not planned properly i guess
  - Were able to get done all of the points until the last
  - Completed on week 10 instead (took a lot longer than i expected), but the code is much neater and much more optimised

### **Week 7 (9 Aug - 15 Aug)** []

- Goal: **UI Update** [COMPLETED - Week 10 Weekends]
  - Improve on the UI of the app in general
  - Chatting functionality [SCRAPPED - No multiplayer so no need for this]
  - Catch up on any updates that have not been done
- Problems:
  - Didn't have much problems doing this one, it was actually done in a matter of 2 days or so
  - The main issue was trying to refractor the chessboard renderer portion of the code to synchronise with the extended part of the chessboard (i.e. the side panels)

### **Important Notice**

> All updates (Week 8 to 10) below were **scrapped** because:

1. I didn't see a need for some of the updates
2. They would take too much time at the moment
3. I completely misjudged the amount of time I would have (because of EOYs and other WA3s hogging up time for Week 8 and 9)

### **Week 8 (16 Aug - 22 Aug)**

- Goal: **Authentication Update** [**SCRAPPED**]
  - Sign up functionality
  - Login functionality
  - Other account-related functionality

### **Week 9 (23 Aug - 29 Aug)**

- Goal: **AI update** [**SCRAPPED**]
  - New section of the website: Playing against an AI
    - Different levels of the AI
  - Set up the AI player
  - Implement basic algorithms for the AI to calculate moves
    - Alpha-beta pruning
    - Min-max searching

### **Week 10 (30 Aug - 5 Sep)**

- Goal: **AI Update-2.0** [**SCRAPPED**]
  - Implement much more complex algorithms
