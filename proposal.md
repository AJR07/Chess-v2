# General description of project
Building an online pass-and-play chess engine. This will be hosted on a website where you can play chess!

# Goals of project
Experiment with making a chess engine that is functional, and in the future extend it for multiple users to be able to play it online. I want to do this so that I can have a chess app that I can use and implement whatever features I can whenever I want to.

# Listing of features
- Game modes:
	- Pass and Play
	- Multiplayer (Potentially in the future)
	- 4-player?
- Game Engine:
	- Renderer and basic UI
	- Verification of legal moves
- Authentication/User Login:
	- Login as a user
	- Store a profile picture, name, etc...
	- Interact with other users (friends list etc)
	- Leaderboards :D
- Chat function:
	- Message other users on the platforms
	- Message other users in the game
